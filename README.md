## A simple and straightforward implementation of Conway's GoL in Python 3.
### No complicated frameworks were used. Easy to understand if you know the basics

**How it works:**
- There are 2 ways you can run this program by manipulating the code: 
  1. With a simplified input prompt (DEFAULT) 
  2. Or with command line argument parsing

  Choose whichever you prefer.

- You can adjust the **size of the grid** and the **update interval** 
- You can either create a **random grid** of alive/dead cells or start
  an empty screen with a **predetermend formation** to watch its behaviour
  *(Currently there is only the glider. More formations will follow)*
  
 Enjoy.
