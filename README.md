## A simple and straightforward implementation of Conway's GoL in Python 3.
### No complicated frameworks were used. Easy to understand if you know the basics

** How it works:
- There are 2 ways you can use this program by manipulating the code: 
  1. With a simplified input prompt (DEFAULT) 
  2. Or with command line parsing
  Choose whichever you prefer.

- You can adjust the size of the grid and the update interval 
- You can either create a random grid of alive/dead cells or start
  an empty screen with a predetermend formation to watch its behaviour
  
 Enjoy.
